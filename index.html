          The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior engineers
          working for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable
          centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the
          French Revolution. In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as "a
          great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top,
          joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals".[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he
          did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's
          architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the
          tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.
